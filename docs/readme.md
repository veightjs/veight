## What is Veight?
Veight is a lightweight front-end web framework for Javascript.  It merges both front-end and back-end together in one framework, and it is also completely tested and working.
```javascript
veight.app("mainApp",function(methods) {
  veight.write(veight.get("#a").innerHTML)
})
```
